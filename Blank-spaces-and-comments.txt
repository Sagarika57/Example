UPPERCASE & LOWERCASE:
In the beginning when HTML was still new, the tags were capitalized.
HTML evolved.
lowercase to write both HTML and the content.
There are thousands of websites out there with capitalized tags and billions of websites with lowercase tags.
All of these websites still work fine.

Different types of tags:

For example, P tag is just a letter, so is the eye tag.
But then there are short word tags like the pre tag and the BR tag.
Then there are full word tags like the article tag and the section tag.
The question is why.
The HTML was invented in the late 80s and 90s and the computer scientists had to work closely and was
worried about every bit and byte.
The memory storage was very limited to one megabyte of Ram and 20MB of storage.
And every character added size to the file.
So it was difficult to maintain the storage.
But as the HTML evolved, so did the storage space too.
Now we have gigabytes to terabytes of storage, so the newer HTML elements have full words.
These elements can take up to as much as as required and are readable to humans too.
So what about the closing tags?
We have seen tags that have closing tags and we have seen tags that do not have a closing tag.
Let's look at an example.
All the newer elements have opening tag and closing tag.
But there are some older tags that do not have a closing tag.
In this example, the P tag, the video tag and the canvas tag have closing tags.
The older elements like IMG tag do not have a closing tag.
If you look at the image tag closely, the image tag do not have a forward slash closing tag.
This is because around 2006 to 2010, everyone was like, You need to have a forward slash on every blank tag.
But later it changed again. 
Now it really doesn't matter if you add or do not add a forward slash to your blank tag.

For example, let's say you want to create a main page or home page for your website.
You should never name it as main dot HTML or home dot HTML instead you should name it as index.html.
If you have pages that are related to styles, you can name these as custom Style.css
Main Style.css or Style.css.
If you are naming the page names, you would have to name something like this.
About.html Services dot HTML products, dot HTML, blog, dot HTML or even post dot HTML.
Always remember to specify the page name as a page purpose.
